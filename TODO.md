# Todo

---

- Implement the POST session as a non-blocking endpoint and have the UI ping a session progress endpoint every *X*ms
for discrete progress updates (both current action i.e. scaling video and rough percent).
- Redesign current SQLite schema and design the 'rest' of it, including all the metrics that we want to calculate
at this current stage.
